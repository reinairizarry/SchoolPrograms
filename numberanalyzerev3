# This program will do the following:
'''Repeatedly ask the user for numbers until they enter a 0 or negative. 
For each number they enter, the program will report if the number was even or odd,
whether it is a perfect square, the sum of the squares of the numbers up to 
and including the number, and the sum of the digits in the number'''
